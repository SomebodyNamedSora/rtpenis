# penis

An experimental rotisserie bot made in TurboWarp.

# How to invite

Whenever the bot is online, you can invite it to your servers using the command `e-invite`.

# Commands
## Without arguments

hello - sends "Hello, World!" to the channel you sent the command to

621 - this used to be a command with arguments but now just says "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2m-89lcOrQ have marz mitzi"

info / cmds - sends an unfinished list of commands

madeoffire - corrects you on the horrendous spelling mistake you made. shame on you!

invite - sends a server invite link for the bot...obviously

httpcat - sends a random HTTP cat :3 

## With arguments

fetch - sends a GET request to a website and sends the result of the request, if it failed; succeeded; what it got; etc. etc.

cat - sends what you put in the command, much like the "echo" command on windows computers or the __"cat"__ command on linux ones.

6api - sends a request to the e621 api with the tags you provided and sends the most recent post as an embed. a filter is set on the command to not send explicit or suggestive posts to unwhitelisted channels, but this may break, you never know when your shitty code finally fails.

pwn - EPICALLY PWNS SOMEONE!!!

# Why the bot isn't always online
